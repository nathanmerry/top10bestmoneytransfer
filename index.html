          <h2>Online Money Transfer</h2>
          <p>
            Transferring money online has never been easier, quicker, and safer.
            With just a few clicks of a mouse—or taps of your finger—you can
            transfer money to other people, make international payments for your
            company, wire money between banks, pay merchants, and more, both
            locally and internationally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Online money transfer is becoming increasingly more popular because
            of its convenience; whereas people used to need to go to the bank or
            wiring office to transfer money, today all you need is access to a
            computer or a smartphone.
          </p>
          <p>
            you're looking to transfer today, here are 3 of the best money
            transfer services around:
          </p>
          <h3>1. <a href="#">XE Money Transfers</a></h3>
          <p>
            XE can make transfers to well over 100 countries across the world,
            working with more than 60 currencies. It also has options that a lot
            of competitors can’t match, namely, there is no minimum or maximum
            daily transfer, and the company doesn’t charge a fee. How do they
            make money then? XE makes money by playing the spread—the difference
            between the exchange rate and the rate given to the customer. The
            company also uses what it describes as “enterprise grade security”
            to keep your data and transfers safe.
          </p>
          <h4>Rates</h4>
          <p>
            The exchange rate you get for your money is determined by XE based
            on the day’s rates given in foreign exchange markets and is only
            fixed after you’ve confirmed your transaction. XE does not charge
            any additional fee for the transfer, though you may be charged by
            the bank when receiving your funds or by an intermediary bank.
          </p>
          <h4>Transfer times</h4>
          <p>
            XE allows customers to make international money transfers 24/7, some
            transfers are completed within 24 hours, though the company advises
            customers to allow 1-4 working days for the beneficiary bank to
            credit the funds to the recipient.
          </p>
          <h4>Limits</h4>
          <p>
            XE does not place any minimum amount on your transfer, though the
            company website does stipulate that you can not exceed $500,000 when
            sending funds. Read the full XE review.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>2. <a href="#">Azimo</a></h3>
          <p>

            process and works with leading banks around the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Azimo charges a conversion fee that typically ranges between 0.1%
            and 2.25%, depending on the transfer amount and destination.
            According to Azimo, their average transfer fee is &pound;1.99.
          </p>
          <h4>Transfer times</h4>
          <p>1-2 working days, depending on destination.</p>
          <h4>Limits</h4>
          <p>
            Azimo&rsquo;s minimum transfer amount is &pound;10, while their
            maximum amount depends on which delivery method you use: Credit card
            transfers have a maximum amount of &pound;12,000, while wire
            transfers have a maximum of &pound;250,000 per transfer. Read the
            full Azimo review.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>3. <a href="#">WorldRemit</a></h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to money transfer options, WorldRemit packs quite a
            punch. You can send money to more than 140 countries across the
            globe, by way of cash pickup, bank deposit, mobile money, or airtime
            top-up. Transfers can be as quick as same day or instant, and the
            company allows you to do so by way of your mobile device. It&rsquo;s
            really as easy as it sounds.
          </p>
          <h4>Rates</h4>
          <p>
            Your first transfer on WorldRemit will not have any fees, after
            that, the amount you are charged depends on where you&rsquo;re
            sending it to. For instance, seeing a transfer of &pound;5,000 to
            the United States will cost &pound;2.99, but if you transfer the
            same amount to Botswana, the cost will be &pound;21.99. There are no
            additional fees charged by WorldRemit for paying by debit, credit,
            or pre-paid cards.
          </p>
          <h4>Transfer times</h4>
          <p>
            The time it takes for a bank transfer to go through depends on the
            destination country, but WorldRemit says that they are usually
            credited within one working day. Cash pickups are typically ready
            instantly, as are mobile money and airtime top-ups.
          </p>
          <h4>Limits</h4>
          <p>
            WorldRemit says that the amount you can send depends on which
            country you&rsquo;re sending to, and that the company itself may
            &ldquo;in our absolute discretion&rdquo; impose limits on the
            transaction amount. Typically the service is only for small amounts
            of money in the thousands at most (up to around
            &pound;8,000-&pound;9,000).
          </p>
          <h4>Types of Transfers available</h4>

          <h3>Sending Money Online: How Does it Work?</h3>
          <p>
            While there&rsquo;s a lot of sophisticated technology behind online
            money transfer, the premise is this: instead of transferring paper
            money, you&rsquo;re transferring data. The data then translates into
            money leaving your account and entering the recipient&rsquo;s
            account. However, because you&rsquo;re transferring data and not
            paper money, online money transfer is often instantaneous. And in
            many cases, all you need to complete the transfer is the
            recipient&rsquo;s phone number or email address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practically, in order to transfer money online, you&rsquo;ll need to
            create an account with a money transfer service like XE, Azimo, or
            WorldRemit. Once you create an account, you&rsquo;ll have different
            options for sending money. You can send online to a bank account or
            ewallet, or you can send paper money to a physical kiosk. In some
            cases, the recipient will need an account with the money transfer
            service in order to receive the funds.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Money Transfer Fees and Rates</h3>
          <p>
            There are 4 factors that determine the fees and rates of each online
            money transfer:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The company you use</li>
            <li>How much money you&rsquo;re transferring</li>
            <li>
              Where you&rsquo;re sending the money (local vs. international)
            </li>
            <li>
              How you&rsquo;re sending the money (bank account, debit card,
              credit card, etc.)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Unless you regularly transfer the same amount of money, you probably
            won&rsquo;t know the transaction fee until you begin the money
            transfer process. However, if you&rsquo;d like to get an idea of how
            much your money transfer will cost, many companies offer free
            estimates, like XE, Azimo, and WorldRemit.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>How Long Does It Take?</h3>
          <p>
            Just like the fees and rates of transferring money depends on a few
            factors, so does the amount of time it takes. Sending money from
            your credit or debit card to someone else&rsquo;s card or to a kiosk
            typically takes a few minutes, whereas transfers from/to bank
            accounts usually take 1-2 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            The discrepancy in transfer time is due to the banks themselves;
            when you transfer between banks, strict anti-fraud measures are
            implemented, which is why it takes longer for the recipient to get
            the money.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, when you transfer money to international banks, in
            addition to anti-fraud measures, a time delay can result due to the
            difference in time zones, regulatory issues in each country, and
            other factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            While these delays can be frustrating, at least you know it&rsquo;s
            because banks are trying to protect their customers.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>How Much Money Can You Send?</h3>
          <p>
            Online money transfer services usually have limits on how much money
            you can transfer at one time or in the span of a certain time
            period. One of the reasons for these limits is for the companies to
            protect themselves and keep costs down; other reasons include fraud
            prevention and compliance with national and international
            regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            While almost every money transfer service has limits, most offer
            some sort of premium service for regular, verified customers that
            includes higher limits.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Where Can You Send Money To?</h3>
          <p>
            When you transfer money, you can send to virtually anywhere in the
            world&mdash;and not only that, you can send to a recipient&rsquo;s
            bank account, ewallet, or to a physical kiosk for pickup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only do people have friends and family around the world, but
            there are hundreds of thousands of workers who work in foreign
            countries and send money home to their families every month. For
            these workers, international money transfer is literally a
            lifesaver.
          </p>

          <h3>How to Find the Best Money Transfer Company</h3>
          <p>
            Finding the best money transfer company means doing a little bit of
            online research. Reading unbiased reviews is the first
            step&mdash;doing so can help you weed out the scams from the
            legitimate services.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you&rsquo;ve read the reviews and are debating between a few
            well-reviewed companies, you can then focus in on what&rsquo;s
            important to you:
          </p>
          <p>
            Rates and fees? If this is the deciding factor, you can use fee
            estimating tools to see which service will offer you the best rates
            for your transfer needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Security? Choose a company that is known for its security features
            and one that will allow you to sleep well at night.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast transfers? If time is of the essence to you, choose the company
            that offers the fastest transfers.
          </p>
          <p>
            If one company offers better rates and another offers faster
            transfers, you can use each one to suit your needs for each
            particular money transfer. Just because you start out using one
            company doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t switch to a different
            company or use 2 simultaneously. Remember, you&rsquo;re paying for
            the service, so you deserve to get the most out of it.
